# GSAP-Google-Loading-Animation

Google uses many different loading animations. The one we’ll be recreating today has four differently colored balls, bouncing in a horizontal line.
That’s all the HTML that’s needed. Everything else is in CSS. The equal width and height make them squares, and the border radius rounds the corners all the way until they appear round.  The margin spaces them apart from one another. Each of the balls will have a different color.
